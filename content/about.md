# Hello, this is my blog.
When most people want to put their thoughts out there, they probably don't think of creating a blog.
When they do, they usually don't host it on a personal website.
When they do, they usually don't use an SSG as unpopular as [Zola](https://getzola.org).
That doesn't matter however, as I am neither most, nor people. So we go on.

This blog was forged near the end of 2022, after I've decided it would a good idea to have a place to put all my ideas in (and also because I despartely wanted an excuse to get a VPS).
It is no ordinary blog, unless you're a programmer, in which case this blog is quite ordinary. It's a blog of *[Romance, Sarcasm, Math, and Language](https://xkcd.com/)*.
Just kidding! Although two of these terms are correct, but you won't know which. This is also a blog about programming and mistakes, a lot of mistakes.

# Who are you?

My name is Yoav Grimland, and I am a student and amateur programmer, programming, solving problems, playing, learning and cooking in his free time.
When I program, I mainly work on things related to compilers and language design, although I like to think my programming interests are expanding.
I am currently learning Haskell, a pure functional programming language, and am interested in learning more.

You can find out more about my work on my [Github](https://github.com/miestrode).

### Why is the blog named "Looking both ways"?
Because good programmers always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street.
