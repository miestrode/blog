When they do, they usually don't host it on a personal website. When they do, they usually don't use an SSG as unpopular as <a href=https://getzola.org>Zola</a>. That doesn't matter however, as I am neither most, nor people. So we go on.<p>This blog was forged near the end of 2022, after I've decided it would a good idea to have a place to put all my ideas in (and also because I despartely wanted an excuse to get a VPS). It is no ordinary blog, unless you're a programmer, in which case this blog is quite ordinary. It's a blog of <em><a href=https://xkcd.com/>Romance, Sarcasm, Math, and Language</a></em>. Just kidding! Although two of these terms are correct, but you won't know which. This is also a blog about programming and mistakes, a lot of mistakes.<h1 id=who-are-you>Who are you?</h1><p>My name is Yoav Grimland, and I am a student and amateur programmer, programming, solving problems, playing, learning and cooking in his free time. When I program, I mainly work on things related to compilers and language design, although I like to think my programming interests are expanding. I am currently learning Haskell, a pure functional programming language, and am interested in learning more.<p>You can find out more about my work on my <a href=https://github.com/miestrode>Github</a>.<h3 id=why-is-the-blog-named-looking-both-ways>Why is the blog named "Looking both ways"?</h3><p>Because good programmers always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street.</div></main><footer class=footer><span>© 2022 <a href=https://miestro.de>Looking both ways</a></span><span>·</span><span>Powered by <a href=https://www.getzola.org rel=noopener target=_blank>Zola</a>️</span><span>·</span><span>Theme️ adapted from <a href=https://github.com/schoenenberg/zola-paper rel=noopener target=_blank>Zola-Paper</a></span></footer>
